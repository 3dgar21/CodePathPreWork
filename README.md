## App Brainstorming (Step 4)


1. **Spotify**

   * Smart playlists that update automatically based on mood or genre
   * Lyrics display in real-time while the song plays

2. **YouTube**

   * Video chapters for easy navigation
   * Auto-captions for accessibility


3. **Google Maps**

   * Real-time traffic updates and rerouting
   * Street view integration

### App Idea

I’d like to build an app called **“StudySync”**, designed to help students form and manage study groups. The app would let users find peers in the same class, schedule group sessions, share notes, and set collaborative reminders. A key feature would be the ability to match users based on availability and study preferences. This app would aim to make remote and in-person collaboration easier for students with busy schedules.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app
One challenge I encountered while building the app was locating the settings within Xcode. Although I’ve used Xcode before, it was mainly for C++ programming, so I’m still getting familiar with the layout and tools used for building iOS apps.
